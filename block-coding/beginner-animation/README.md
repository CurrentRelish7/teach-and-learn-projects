 Block-Based Collection Game

 Overview
A small interactive project built using block-based programming to explore event-driven behavior, control flow, and state tracking.

 Concepts
- Events
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Variables
- Motion and visual feedback

 Notes
I experimented with movement speed and collision conditions to keep the behavior simple and predictable.
